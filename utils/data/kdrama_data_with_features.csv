And then it went from survival game to revenge plot, and all the twists became a bit too convenient toward the later episodes.

That made no sense, since Death told him he couldnt kill himself, but he literally did as that man.

The main highlights were the teenage flashbacks of the main couple’s love story, and the lead up to then dating after they reuinted as adults. However, this is one of those romantic comedy kdramas that suffers from some classic pitfalls. For one, it adds a completely unnecessary evil uncle embezzlement/indirect murder plot that was so pointless and kind of ruined the tone of the drama. Secondly, it got very boring after the main couple actually got together, which can happen in a lot of dramas. The tension and entertainment revolved around the will-they-wont-they aspect of the plot, and once they actually did get together, there was not enough chemsitry nor cute couple moments. Finally, the ensemble cast and side plots were not that strong. I did kind of like the nurse and teacher couple by the end, but there really were no standout side characters and in fact many of them were quite annoying like the sabotaging best friend, male lead’s dad, and gossiping teacher.

There was also an absurd amount of product placement in the last 5 episodes that was really distracting and weird for the vibe of the show.

My Dearest Nemesis,그놈은 흑염룡,Black Salt Dragon,2025,https://mydramalist.com/767207-black-salt-dragon,"I wasnt sure about this drama during the first two episodes, but by episode 3 or 4 I was solidly hooked. It does the enemies to lovers trope well in that the main leads start off just as normal work nemeses due to the male lead’s tsundere personality clashing with the female lead’s ambitious one. But then there’s also the twist here of them actually being each others’ first loves and first breakups and they dont know it. The build up to them finding out was done well, and while it was a little hard to believe that their middle/high school crushes/online relationship from 10+ years ago still left them with so much trauma, I appreciated that the dilemma over whether or not to break up in the present timeline was not dragged out. The grandma and the blaming her grandson for his parents’ death plot line was annoying but whatever. The second couple was super cute, though I did want more of them. Both couples had a lot of chemistry. The main male lead was truly adorable. Even his cringey dorky moments were endearing. The ending was wrapped up a little too nicely but i didnt mind that. This was a very easy to watch, entertaining rom com. Kind of like business proposal. A little bit of melodrama, good chemistry, healthy dose of comedy, some heart-fluttering kick your feet moments. A fun watch.",8.5,https://i.mydramalist.com/l0Dqz6_4t.jpg,8.1,"In high school, Baek Su Jeong developed a crush on an online player named ""Black Dragon,"" only to be humiliated when he turned out to be an awkward middle schooler.

Squid Game Season 2,오징어게임 시즌2,Squid Game Season ,2024,https://mydramalist.com/714529-squid-game-season-2,"Slow start but was still a fun watch with several surprising twists like when one of the characters featured turned out to be a masked guard not a player, and when player 001 turned out to be the frontman (the police officer’s brother). But it felt like half a season, not a full season, and lacked the punch and impact that season 1 had. I didn’t feel as emotionally invested in the characters as I was in season 1, with the exception of the transgender woman played by Park Sung Hoon, who was by far my favorite character. Its understandable that sequels are usually setup in a trilogy, but what started as a revenge plot ended up being a bit of a letdown because the main character Gihoon basically had no plan at all until the last episode where he suddenly gets a crew together to steal the guards’ guns, but it goes nowhere. Even if the frontman/player 001 hadn’t betrayed him and sabotaged the plan in the end, it probably wouldn’t have succeeded…so it feels like we’re back at square one with no plot movement at all, especially since the plotline with the police officer went nowhere the entire season.

The trailers didnt grab me initially when this came out but then i kept hearing good things about this drama and im so glad i decided to watch it. The male lead was so good at playing a depressed person and then it was such a joy to watch him become happy again, and he was equally good at playing both a clueless but earnest father trying his best and a hopeless romantic. the female lead was also great, and between this drama and be melodramatic she is shaping up to be one of my favorite korean actresses of all time. the writing and plot was so fun, refreshing, and original. I cried so many tears while watching this show. I loved the love story, it was a very cosmic one, what with the “my past is your future” threadline but it was also so full of cute little moments that felt real, and not forced or like fan service. I love when kdrama romances feel genuine, and arent overly chaste or infanfile, and this one was mature and intense without being overly melodramatic or over the too. Also loved all the wholesome dad-daughter moments. The mom and sister could be kind of annoying, but they good redemption arcs. There were some really emotional and well done moments related to weight and emotional eating that really hit home for me. My heart just felt so warm while watching this show. And then i was crying for the entire last 20 minutes of the finale. The ending of the male lead’s son having the super power of beinf able to retrieve lost things and bring back his dad was so sweet. That final moment when the leads reunite was precious. I wish there’d been more of a reunion, but the moment and the ending overall was well done. Also the OST and cinematography was very good.

The Midnight Romance in Hagwon,졸업,Graduation,2024,https://mydramalist.com/755679-graduation,"Wow, this drama made me feel so much. Some moments it felt like a warm hug, other times it made me cry because it was so relatable in showing those moments when work and life just really bring you down. Its depiction of a realistic romance was so beautiful and refreshing. The main couple had so much chemistry and comfort with each other and their development throughout the 16 episodes was mature and thoughtful. I especially appreciated the sex positivity, which is characteristic of this writer/director and reminded me of Something in the Rain (though this drama was SO much better than that one). I also loved the scenes where the couple got in heated debates/arguments. These arguments were never toxic or dramatic, but were instead really interesting and realistic depictions of two headstrong, passionate, and stubborn people debating how to work within the flawed Korean education system, with Jun Ho wanting to teach in a new way and Hye Jin wanting to help students make the system work for them. And honestly they were just so fun to watch. I really liked the slow burn pace of this drama and that so much attention and space was afforded to the romance; this allowed it to feel fully developed so that when the marriage proposal came at the end I was so invested I was in tears. But even though the pace was slower, the drama never felt boring. I also loved the second couple too, and overall the acting of the whole cast was impeccable. This was a drama where I wouldn’t have minded 20 episodes: it would have been nice to see more of the second couple, Hye Jin meeting Jun Ho’s parents, Hye Jin in law school, a more complete ending for Pyo Sang Sub, and more of the fate of the Daechi Chase academy. But I’m happy with the finale — it wrapped things up well without feeling like everything ended too neatly or abruptly. I’m going to miss this drama and even the silly opening and ending theme songs. What a gem — so glad I didnt skip this one! I’m 
smiling just thinking about it. Probably a drama I’ll return to in the future, and definitely became one of my favorite romance dramas.

Then again he chose in the end to be with her in death for eternity rather than continue living as king. I agree that it would have been satisfying to have an ending where she is free and with her friends but somehow this ending feels more complex - she did love him as a person but not as the king and in the end he chose her over being the king but only could in death bc he was trapped just as much as she was.

Though humans never give much thought to how they manage to function, day in and day out, the cells within the human body are constantly at work, doing their part to keep their humans alive and well. This is why on the outside, Kim Yoo Mi may appear to be just like every other single working woman in the world, but underneath that ordinary exterior lies something truly extraordinary. Having recently suffered a painful breakup, Yoo Mi’s love cells have fallen into a deep coma. While the surrounding cells work hard to revive their fallen compatriots, Yoo Mi spends her days stuck in the grind of everyday life. With a heart still broken and no romantic prospects, Yoo Mi’s love cells might have been in serious trouble had it not been for the sudden appearance of Goo Woong. An emotionally stunted game developer, Goo Woong has no idea how to express his true feelings, but after meeting Yoo Mi, he finds himself wanting to try. With his own love cells unexpectedly sparking Yoo Mi’s back to life, things between the two start to get interesting. With both Yoo Mi and Goo Woong’s cells working overtime, the two find themselves drawing ever closer. But will the efforts of this small collection of cells really be enough to bring two hearts together forever?
