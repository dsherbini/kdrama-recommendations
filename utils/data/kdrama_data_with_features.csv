Be Melodramatic,https://mydramalist.com/26488-the-nature-of-a-melo,"This drama is so special. Every character has so much depth and is delightfully weird and complicated. Each relationship, even the side couples, is interesting and compelling in their own way. The main couple is surprisingly sweet and has a lot of chemistry. It might be one of my favorite romances ever. It was delightfully slow burn, but with depth and cuteness and humor. Gave me fanny flutters for sure.

The oppa scene made me laugh so hard. The whole fart episode was so funny. So many scenes made me cry. It’s so relatable but also so meta and and the plot truly kept me guessing the whole time. Each episode I was just along for this delightful, odd, heartwarming ride.

Death's Game,https://mydramalist.com/733445-i-will-die-soon,"There was a lot of hype around this show and I finally got around to watching it. I was especially excited about the all star cast and the rotating roster of cameos. But it was a huge letdown and was highly over-rated. It felt like a very heavy handed PSA against suicide without any real or nuanced deep dive into mental health or depression. And then it went from survival game to revenge plot, and all the twists became a bit too convenient toward the later episodes. Plus, there were major plot holes like why some reincarnations were not linear and why the main character did not change his fate during the 11th reincarnation when he was in the body of the man who ran into traffic on his interview day, setting off the initial chain of events. That made no sense, since Death told him he couldnt kill himself, but he literally did as that man.

Love Your Enemy,https://mydramalist.com/763553-love-on-a-single-log-bridge,"Overall a cute drama with some funny moments. The main highlights were the teenage flashbacks of the main couple’s love story, and the lead up to then dating after they reuinted as adults. However, this is one of those romantic comedy kdramas that suffers from some classic pitfalls. For one, it adds a completely unnecessary evil uncle embezzlement/indirect murder plot that was so pointless and kind of ruined the tone of the drama. Secondly, it got very boring after the main couple actually got together, which can happen in a lot of dramas. The tension and entertainment revolved around the will-they-wont-they aspect of the plot, and once they actually did get together, there was not enough chemsitry nor cute couple moments. Finally, the ensemble cast and side plots were not that strong. I did kind of like the nurse and teacher couple by the end, but there really were no standout side characters and in fact many of them were quite annoying like the sabotaging best friend, male lead’s dad, and gossiping teacher.

My Demon,https://mydramalist.com/746993-my-demon,"a bit of a rollercoaster of a drama (not in a good way lol). started off kinda boring but by episode 4-5 i was invested. the fake marriage plot was cute and there were some really funny memorable scenes like the tango scene and the two assistants out-clapping each other at the wedding. had some cute couple moments in the middle. villains/chaebol family played their roles well. but then the writing fell apart at the end. male lead sacrifices himself for the FL by bringing her back to life at the end of ep 15, only to then magically reappear 15 minutes into the final episode. also the villain fell from a skyscraper and was crushed under a chunk of ceiling and still didnt die…i also think madame ju got off too easy for basically causing dohee’s mother’s death. and ML didnt even turn into a human in the end?! despite some cute/good moments in the middle, the major plot holes at the end/the dumb ending definitely lower the rating of the drama overall. male and female leads are super pretty tho and had good chemistry.","['bit', 'rollercoaster', 'drama', 'good', 'way', 'lol', 'started', 'kinda', 'boring', 'episode', '45', 'invested', 'fake', 'marriage', 'plot', 'cute', 'really', 'funny', 'memorable', 'scene', 'like', 'tango', 'scene', 'two', 'assistant', 'outclapping', 'wedding', 'cute', 'couple', 'moment', 'middle', 'villainschaebol', 'family', 'played', 'role', 'well', 'writing', 'fell', 'apart', 'end', 'male', 'lead', 'sacrifice', 'fl', 'bringing', 'back', 'life', 'end', 'ep', '15', 'magically', 'reappear', '15', 'minute', 'final', 'episode', 'also', 'villain', 'fell', 'skyscraper', 'crushed', 'chunk', 'ceiling', 'still', 'didnt', 'diei', 'also', 'think', 'madame', 'ju', 'got', 'easy', 'basically', 'causing', 'dohees', 'mother', 'death', 'ml', 'didnt', 'even', 'turn', 'human', 'end', 'despite', 'cutegood', 'moment', 'middle', 'major', 'plot', 'hole', 'endthe', 'dumb', 'ending', 'definitely', 'lower', 'rating', 'drama', 'overall', 'male', 'female', 'lead', 'super', 'pretty', 'tho', 'good', 'chemistry']",0.12247023809523808,0.25859374999999996,0.12692736185383244,,0.13431372549019607,0.11643270944741532,,,,,0.13775584795321638,,0.07144097222222222,,,0.1427579365079365,,,,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Squid Game Season 2,https://mydramalist.com/714529-squid-game-season-2,"Slow start but was still a fun watch with several surprising twists like when one of the characters featured turned out to be a masked guard not a player, and when player 001 turned out to be the frontman (the police officer’s brother). But it felt like half a season, not a full season, and lacked the punch and impact that season 1 had. I didn’t feel as emotionally invested in the characters as I was in season 1, with the exception of the transgender woman played by Park Sung Hoon, who was by far my favorite character. Its understandable that sequels are usually setup in a trilogy, but what started as a revenge plot ended up being a bit of a letdown because the main character Gihoon basically had no plan at all until the last episode where he suddenly gets a crew together to steal the guards’ guns, but it goes nowhere. Even if the frontman/player 001 hadn’t betrayed him and sabotaged the plan in the end, it probably wouldn’t have succeeded…so it feels like we’re back at square one with no plot movement at all, especially since the plotline with the police officer went nowhere the entire season.

The Atypical Family,https://mydramalist.com/748581-although-i-am-not-a-hero,"Wow. What a gem of a show. The trailers didnt grab me initially when this came out but then i kept hearing good things about this drama and im so glad i decided to watch it. The male lead was so good at playing a depressed person and then it was such a joy to watch him become happy again, and he was equally good at playing both a clueless but earnest father trying his best and a hopeless romantic. the female lead was also great, and between this drama and be melodramatic she is shaping up to be one of my favorite korean actresses of all time. the writing and plot was so fun, refreshing, and original. I cried so many tears while watching this show. I loved the love story, it was a very cosmic one, what with the “my past is your future” threadline but it was also so full of cute little moments that felt real, and not forced or like fan service. I love when kdrama romances feel genuine, and arent overly chaste or infanfile, and this one was mature and intense without being overly melodramatic or over the too. Also loved all the wholesome dad-daughter moments. The mom and sister could be kind of annoying, but they good redemption arcs. There were some really emotional and well done moments related to weight and emotional eating that really hit home for me. My heart just felt so warm while watching this show. And then i was crying for the entire last 20 minutes of the finale. The ending of the male lead’s son having the super power of beinf able to retrieve lost things and bring back his dad was so sweet. That final moment when the leads reunite was precious. I wish there’d been more of a reunion, but the moment and the ending overall was well done. Also the OST and cinematography was very good.

The Judge from Hell,https://mydramalist.com/758169-the-judge-from-hell,"A pretty interesting drama. It’s an enemy to lovers story with a twist. The twist being that they are actually legitimate enemies: her a corrupt judge who gives murderers light sentences and him a homicide detective who wants to put the murderers in prison. The next twist is that she’s actually a demon who has to kill the murderers and send them to hell, which is why she needs to let them off easy in court. I liked the creative way the show called attention to corruption in the justice system while also developing the cat and mouse game between the two leads for the first half of the show.

The Red Sleeve,https://mydramalist.com/61399-dress-sleeved-red,It’s hard to describe my feelings after this drama. The show was so tragic. It was so hard to see the FL give up her freedom in exchange for love when the king could not fully love her. Then again he chose in the end to be with her in death for eternity rather than continue living as king. I agree that it would have been satisfying to have an ending where she is free and with her friends but somehow this ending feels more complex - she did love him as a person but not as the king and in the end he chose her over being the king but only could in death bc he was trapped just as much as she was.

melodrama territory, but the pacing is to be expected since its such a short miniseries. As annoying as the main couple’s miscommunication is at times, I do think their struggles were kind of realistic and relatable. I also liked that this story shows an international and cross-cultural couple; I think this is the first kdrama I’ve watched that features this as the main couple. I didn’t love it overall, but it was cool to see the juxtaposition of Japanese and Korean culture and language, and I was very impressed by the main actress’s Japanese.
